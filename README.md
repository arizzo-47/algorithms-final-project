EECE 2560 - Fundamental of Algorithms Final Project

Command line application determines the shortest path between Northeastern University campus locations from a text file defining 
distances between points, creating a traversable graph. User provides start and end location and the program utilizes Dijkstra's 
algorithm to determine minimum path. 

Outputs sequence of graph nodes that must be traversed to reach end location along with distances.

Functionally mimics Google maps shortest-path logic at a less granular level.
